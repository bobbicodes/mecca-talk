Script and slides for MECCA history and demo

It was only this year that I discovered through reading Rich Hickey's paper for the History of Programming Languages that before becoming a programmer he was a musician and ran a recording studio, and cut his programming teeth by writing music software. In my favorite of his "classic" talks, "Design, Composition and Performance", he does an amazing job of framing software design in terms of music. Many of the ideas explored are common to the motivations of this project, MECCA that I'll be discussing today, so much that it is a shocking fact that I came to them entirely on my own, when I'd only heard of Clojure. The similarity is right down to the title! Both express the same point of distinguishing the processes involved in making things.

There has been no shortage of music libraries for Clojure. Rich even has one, called Harmonikit. That and several others have been a huge inspiration, though I've approached the space from a decidingly different angle.

Specifically:

- Overtone (Sam Aaron et al, Harmonikit uses this)
- Alda, Mantra, Chronoid (Dave Yarwood)
- cljs-bach, Leipzic, etc. (Chris Ford)
- Sonic-cljs (Bruce Hauman)
